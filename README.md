# VersatileCodeLab

Welcome to the VersatileCodeLab repository! This repository hosts a project aimed at introducing students to bash scripting and Python programming for simulating processes, including pipes and process control. Whether you're a student looking to expand your programming skills or an enthusiast eager to explore the world of scripting and process simulation, this project has something for you.

## Introduction
The project was developed as part of the Software Development Tools and Systems Programming course, serving as the second assignment. It encompasses various components, including a bash script for news analysis, sentiment analysis, process simulation in Python, and mixed piping implementation.

## Project Overview
### [NewsAnalyzer](https://github.com/CodeMaestro1/VersatileCodeLab/tree/main/Problem_2)
The NewsAnalyzer script analyzes news articles using the Jaccard Index and sentiment analysis techniques, providing insights into document similarity and sentiment.

### [Sentiment Analysis](https://github.com/CodeMaestro1/VersatileCodeLab/tree/main/Problem_3)
This component determines the sentiment of news articles based on the presence of positive and negative stems, enhancing the understanding of document sentiment.

### [Process Simulation (Python Program)](https://github.com/CodeMaestro1/VersatileCodeLab/tree/main/Problem_4)
The Python program simulates processes involving pipes and process control, offering hands-on experience in process management and communication.

### [Mixed Piping Implementation (Python Program)](https://github.com/CodeMaestro1/VersatileCodeLab/tree/main/Problem_5)
This section describes a Python script consisting of three functions: source_process, transformer_process, and output_process, using anonymous and FIFO pipes to simulate a data processing pipeline.
